# Overview #
A simple To Do List web application that can be deployed on a local server with Express.js.
Users can add tasks to a to do list and give each an appropriate description. Users can then select one or more tasks to mark as completed and be deleted from the list.

# Future Improvements/Ideas #
- Add an optional "Due Date" field for tasks. This can be further expanded by adding a sorting functionality based on the due date of the tasks.
- Add an optional "Importance" field for tasks.
